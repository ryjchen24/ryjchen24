# Hi, I’m Ryan

I’m a CS student at **UC Irvine** interested in **Machine Learning, Data Science, and Applied AI**.  
I enjoy working with real-world datasets, building models from first principles, and understanding how modern ML systems work under the hood.

## What I’m Currently Working On
- Implementing neural networks **from scratch** using NumPy to deeply understand backpropagation and optimization
- Training **PyTorch-based models** on image datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST) and comparing performance to custom implementations
- Building and evaluating **machine learning models** on large-scale, real-world datasets
